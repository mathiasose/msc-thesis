\chapter{CA-NEAT Parameters}
\label{app:parameters}
CA-NEAT has a large number of parameters that affect the outcome of the experiments.
This appendix lists some notable ones that would be needed to reproduce the results in this thesis consistently.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption={
Parameters that define the initial population.
Notably, for each generated individual,
the ratio of connectivity is determined individually to be a value between $0.5$ and $1.0$.

    initial_hidden_nodes = 0
    initial_connection = 'partial'
    connection_fraction = lambda *args: 0.5 * (1 + random.random())
\end{lstlisting}
