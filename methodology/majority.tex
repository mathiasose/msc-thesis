\section{Majority Problem}
The majority problem is a problem for binary CA.
An arbitrary initial configuration should have one "color" be more common than the other.
The CA must figure out which color this is and end up in a point attractor state where all the cells are this color.
Depending on the initial configuration this can be very difficult.
Even if the majority of the configuration is black, there might be a sub-region that is majority white.
The lack of global overview means that the CA needs to send "signals" around and "negotiate" a consensus.
