\section{Novelty Search}
In order to extend CA-NEAT for novelty search, some phenotype value needs to be measured and compared in order to calculate novelty.
The enumerated "string" representation of the transition function was selected for this.
The \textit{Hamming distance} between different strings can then be calculated and used as a measure of novelty distance.
