In \cite{wolper-2015}, Wolper and Abraham used evolution and CPPNs to find seed patterns for Conway's Game of Life \cite{berlekamp1982winning}.
They tried both normal CPPN-NEAT (objective search) and a variation called novelty search \cite{lehman-2008}.
The results were varied, but the conclusion was in support of further research into using CPPNs for CA problems.

Many different kinds of CA encodings have been investigated previously.
These include \textit{conditionally matching rules} \cite{bidlo2013evolution, bidlo2015investigation, bidlo2015routine},
\textit{instruction-based development} \cite{bidlo2008instruction, bidlo2012evolution, nichele2016genotype,nichele2014evolutionary,nichele2016evolutionary}
\textit{self-modifying cartesian genetic programming} \cite{harding2011self}
and \textit{variable length gene regulatory networks} \cite{trefzer2013advantages}.
The paper \cite{nichele2014evolutionary} by Nichele and Tufte investigates an instruction based encoding.
The experiments in this paper repeat those of that paper, using the new CPPN encoding.
