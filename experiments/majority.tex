\section{Majority Problem}
The \textit{majority problem} is a problem for 1D binary CA.
It is also called the \textit{density classification task} in literature \cite{mitchell1993revisiting, mitchell1996evolving}.
In this task, the CA should have some arbitrary initial configuration where one "color" (black/white) is more common than the other.
The CA must then figure out which color this is and end up in a point attractor state where all the cells are of this color.
Depending on the initial configuration this can be easy, or very difficult, so finding a general solution that can figure out any initial configuration is difficult.
Even if the majority of the configuration is black, there might be a sub-region that is majority white.
The lack of global overview means that the CA needs to send information around the grid and "negotiate" a consensus about the color.
This problem has been studied extensively with table-based transition functions found by genetic algorithm \cite{mitchell1993revisiting, mitchell1996evolving, mitchell-2001} 

The experiment design here is inspired by the design in TODO cite.

10 initial configurations are created with a specific ratio of black and white cells, but in a random order.
Five are white-dominated and five are black-dominated.
The fitness function tests the rule on each of the configurations and calculates whether the
